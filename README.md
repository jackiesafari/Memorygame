# Jackie's 2024 project: Memory Game  
## Each time you click on a tile you will view an image of a food item. Your goal is to match them all.

This project is the first of many to showcase my knowledge of Javascript. You can view the sample project on Github pages or you can use instructions below 
to view the project on your local code editor (I use VS code). 

1. Clone the repository. [How to clone repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Open your code editor (I'm using VS Code)
3. Left click on "index.htm" and select copy path
4. Open your desired browser (I'm using Google chrome)
5. Paste the path on your browser
6. Have fun!
